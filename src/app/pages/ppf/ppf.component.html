      <p class="section-text">
        Paint Protection Film (PPF) is a thermoplastic urethane film applied to painted surfaces of vehicles. 
        It provides an invisible layer of protection against rock chips, bug splatter, minor abrasions, 
        and harmful UV rays. Our premium PPF features self-healing technology that makes minor scratches 
        disappear with heat exposure.
